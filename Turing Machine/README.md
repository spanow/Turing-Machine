# TuringMachine Interpreter

Turing achine interpreter done for a school project (Paris Descartes, Complexit√© algorithmique).
A quick explanation of the files in this repo : 

    * machines_tes : 2 description files to test the interpreter
    * turing_machines.pdf : project instructions
    * build.sh : build the project /!\ needs c++11, uses g++ (unix system required)
    * src : project sources

The sources are heavily commented.
The program is assumming there are an infinite number of blank symbols at the end of your inputs, a valid input leads your machine to a final state.

Refer to turing_machines.pdf to understand the formating of the turing machines file description and the command lines arguments.
